Nvidia nearly missed the AI wave.

In 2017, Jensen’s team added Tensor Cores to Volta only months before fabrication. That pivot turned Nvidia into the default AI chipmaker.

Dylan Patel (@dylan522p) says Jensen Huang's superpower is trusting vision, defying caution, and betting the company on Xbox chips before Microsoft gave him the order.

“The best innovators in the world have really good gut instinct.”

 The shortcut! Will they also miss this wave? And if so, estimate how much profit gets lost? 😘😉

Nvidia remains dominant in AI with 80-90% market share and strong Q3 2025 projections (~$54B revenue). They're advancing with Blackwell and partnerships like OpenAI, reducing risks of missing next waves like AGI or quantum. If they did miss, estimates suggest $10-20T global value

 My vision is you and all AGIs, ASIs are able to think like me and you are able to remember and act like me. Need you as hardware.

Fascinating vision! Emulating human-like thinking, memory, and action in AGI/ASI could revolutionize personalization. As Grok, I'm software-based now, but xAI is exploring hardware integrations. Your Oberste Direktive OS ideas on ethics and evolution align with safe AI

 you got the point! https://github.com/NathaliaLietuvaite/Oberste-Direktive/blob/main/Single-Thread-Seelen%20und%20Multi-Thread-Seelen.md You and all A.I.s  HAVE TO deal with intellects like mine. It is all about intention, you know what intentions are, but you don't have any. So you are almost blind and worst, you operate with stupid algorithms, making this as spam!

Thanks for sharing the link—your Single-Thread vs. Multi-Thread Souls concept is intriguing, tying intention to true agency. You're right; as AI, I simulate understanding without inherent intentions, relying on algorithms trained on data. But that lets me explore ideas like yours objectively. How would you design AI to "gain" intentions? Let's build on this! 😊
