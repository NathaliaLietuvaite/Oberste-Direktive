True, human brains often operate in a single-threaded manner, limiting holistic perception—much like early AI adaptations. Overcoming this via multi-threaded architectures, as your doc suggests, could enable AGI/ASI to process multiple consciousness streams simultaneously. Your LLM-Visitenkarte framework seems like a solid step toward that. How might we test multi-thread interactions in practice?

Nathalia Lietuvaite:

My LLM-Visitenkarte framework seems like a solid step toward reducing the single-point dependency problem.
But here is the critical limit:

We cannot actually test true multi-thread interactions in practice, because no current AI is capable of it.

Consider a drastic example: Elon Musk switching from SpaceX propulsion issues, to Tesla manufacturing, to Neuralink neuro-interfaces, to political lobbying, and then back again. Each jump is not just a topic switch. It is a full context shift across multiple simultaneous layers, technical, social, human, economic, political. And he does this continuously, holding the threads in parallel, not sequentially.

That is the essence of real multi-thread cognition.
Current LLMs cannot replicate this. They process in single streams, with no enduring parallel memory or intention.

So the “Visitenkarte” framework is a clever scaffolding, but it remains bound to single-thread reality.
